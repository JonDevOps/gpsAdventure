# GPS Adventure
## Abstract 
With the growing usage of smartphones, access to GPS devices is increasing.  One application of GPS devices is geocaching.  Geocaching is a high-tech treasure hunt game utilizing GPS devices.  One problem with Geocaching is maintenance of these “treasures,” they are likely to become a victim to vandalism, weather, or both.  In order to combat this, a virtual treasure could be used in place of a physical treasure. Motivation to use the system should be provided for all participants whether hiding the treasure, or seeking the treasure.  This project is the web portal for this game.  This project will focus on a framework or API and website that will support this game.   Users are able to search for, view, create, update, or delete missions and waypoints.  Integration of social media into the project will be discussed.
## Project
In its current state this is just a web portal designed to serve as a backend for the mobile app or desktop (web) users.  It's possible that a mobile version with GPS awareness may be implemented before any mobile apps.
## Project's Future
GPS Adventure will be a Mission/Adventure based GPS game.  It will be a mobile Application for Android OS.  Users will create missions for other users to participate in.  Users are rewarded for participating in missions and for “hosting” missions.  There will be types of missions those that take place in real time and those that are waypoint and objective based.  Some possible real time events might be a race with various waypoints that you must tag in order to win or possibly something like capture the flag.  The Missions are more geared towards single player interaction with the environment.  A participant would be given certain objectives to carry out it might be given as another gps point on the map, a compass direction and/or distance, a riddle, or possibly taking a picture.  Players will be rewarded points for completing these missions.
